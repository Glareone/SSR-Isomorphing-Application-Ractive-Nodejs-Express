### Purposes:
This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Ractive including 
CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Ractive community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the RealWorld repo.

### To start application:
1. npm install
2. npm start

### To parse templates (app.html, footer.html, navbar.html)
1. npm run parse

In 'src/templates/parsed' folder you will find those parsed templates
